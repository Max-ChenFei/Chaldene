<!--
BEFORE YOU OPEN AN ISSUE, PLEASE READ THIS

Hello! Thank you for using Jupyter Notebook. We're glad you're here.

Right now, you're opening an issue. Before you do, let's make sure this is the right place to post your question/issue.

First, it's important to know that Jupyter Notebook development has moved into a phase of maintenance-only. There are very few people with limited time maintaining this repository. This means, we won't likely accept new features here. Instead, we recommend that you check out JupyterLab (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)â€”Jupyter's next generation Notebook interface.

Here, we're looking for specific bugs in the Jupyter Notebook codebase. If you think you've identified such a bug, you can continue opening your issue here. We'd appreciate if you include as much detail as possible, i.e. links to the offending code, snapshots of the UI issue, code-blocks with your console logs, etc.

If you're having issues installing Jupyter Notebook, or you're having another issue and don't know how to proceed, try the following:

1. scan the "What to do when things go wrong" (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/troubleshooting.html#what-to-do-when-things-go-wrong) page in our documentation to see if your question has already been answered

2. post your question on the Jupyter Notebook discourse channel (https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/notebook/31). There are many more people in the Jupyter community that engage on that channel.
